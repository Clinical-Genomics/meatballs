- Heat the oven to 190C/fan170C/gas 5 and line two baking sheets with non-stick baking paper.
- Put 150g softened salted butter, 80g light brown muscovado sugar and 80g granulated sugar into a bowl and beat until creamy.

- Use a teaspoon to make small scoops of the mixture, spacing them well apart on the baking trays. This mixture should make about 30 cookies.
