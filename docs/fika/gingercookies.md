### Gingerbread Cookie Ingredients

- Sugar: You'll need about a cup of sugar for the cookie dough, plus about two tablespoons of sugar for rolling the dough balls.
- Flour: All-purpose flour gives the cookies structure and helps create a tender texture.
- Spices: These soft gingerbread cookies are spiced with ginger, cinnamon, and cloves.
- Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it makes the dough rise.
- Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.
- Butter: Butter is great for making perfectly soft ginger cookies with slightly crisp edges. If you'd like, you can substitute margarine.
- Egg: An egg adds moisture and acts as a binding agent (it holds the dough together).
- Molasses: Molasses lends warm, cozy, and sweet flavor to these soft gingerbread cookies.
