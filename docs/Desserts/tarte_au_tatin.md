To make the dough see the Sugar Dough recipe.
## Ingredients
- See ingredients for Sugar Dough
- 2 kg apples
- 200 g of sugar
- 200 g of butter
- 1 tsp of vanilla sugar
## Steps
1. Peel, de-core and quarter the apples.
2. Set the oven to 180 degrees Celsius.
3. In an oven-safe pan melt the butter. When it starts to bubble add two thirds of the sugar.
4. When the sugar has melted place the apples in the pan in a pattern you like. Make sure to pack them close.
5. Pour the remaining sugar over the apples.
6. Let sit on medium heat until the caramel (butter and sugar mixture) starts turning brown. Do not stir.
7. While the caramel is cooking take the dough out of the fridge and roll i t out to a width of 0.5 cm.
8. Cut out a circle with the radius of your pan plus 3-5 cm.
9. When the caramel starts browning roll your dough onto a rolling pin and roll it out over the apples in the pan.
10. Tuck in the borders and cut a 1 cm hole into the middle of the dough for air to escape.
11. Put the pan into the oven and cook until the dough turns golden/brown.
12. Once taken out of the oven, cover with a large plate or cutting board, and with a swift motion flip the tarte out 
of the pan (Beware of boiling caramel). 
13. Enjoy!

(Tip: Clean the pan while still hot to avoid having to deal with rock solid caramel)
