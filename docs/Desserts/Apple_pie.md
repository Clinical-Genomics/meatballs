## Ingredients
1. 1/3 cup sugar
2. 1/3 cup packed brown sugar
3. 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
4. 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
5. 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
6. 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
7. 6 to 7 cups thinly sliced peeled tart apples
8. 1 tablespoon lemon juice
9. Dough for double-crust pie
10. 1 tablespoon Kerrygold Salted Butter
11. 1 large egg white
12. Optional: Turbinado or coarse sugar, ground cinnamon, vanilla bean ice cream and caramel sauce

## Method

Preheat oven to 375Â°. On a lightly floured surface, roll one half of dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle; transfer to a 9-in. pie plate. In a small bowl, combine sugars, flour and spices; set aside. In a large bowl, toss apples with lemon juice. Add sugar mixture; toss to coat. Add filling; dot with butter.

Roll remaining dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle. Place over filling. Trim, seal and flute edge. Cut slits in top. Beat egg white until foamy; brush over crust. If desired, sprinkle with turbinado sugar and ground cinnamon. Cover edge loosely with foil.

Bake 25 minutes. Remove foil; bake until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly, 20-25 minutes longer. Cool on a wire rack. If desired, serve with ice cream and caramel sauce.
