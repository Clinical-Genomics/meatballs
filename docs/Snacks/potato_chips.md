## **Preparations**

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Prep a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone mat.

**Prep potatoes:** Using a sharp knife, food processor attachment or mandolin, thinly slice the potatoes to about 1/16 of an inch. Pat the potatoes dry to remove excess moisture. Toss potatoes with oil and salt in medium size bowl (or you can go to the next step and lightly coat each side with oil while on the cookie sheet using a silicon brush – one less thing to wash this way, which was my way).


**Roast:** Place the potatoes in a single layer on the baking sheet, spread them out so they don’t tough each other. Place in the oven and bake for 10 minutes. Carefully remove from the oven, turn each chip and bake another 7 – 9 minutes, keep an eye on them towards the end so they don’t overcook. Remove any that seem ready or about to burn completely. Once baked, remove from oven and let cool for 2 – 5 min. Enjoy!
